6 ContributorsOrpheus Lyrics[Verse 1]
How do you know which time might be the last?
What I would give just to see you again
I'd walk to the depths of a world down below
And demand to get back what some circumstance stole

[Pre-Chorus]
I still remember the last look of hope in your eyes
Oh, I wish I had stayed just a little while

[Chorus]
But I opened the door and I went down the stairs
I turned back one last time just to prove you were there
You said, "If you can see me, it's all in your head"
But it feels real to me now, it felt real to me then

[Verse 2]
How do you know which memories to save?
Like the very last footprint that Orpheus made
'Cause the last ray of sun made Eurydice cold
And did she know? Did she know?
Did she know? Did she know?

[Pre-Chorus]
I still remember the last look of hope in your eyes
Oh, I wish I had stayed just a little while
You might also like[Chorus]
But I opened the door and I went down the stairs
I turned back one last time just to prove you were there
You said, "If you can see me, it's all in your head"
But it feels real to me now, it felt real to me then

[Bridge]
If I knew how it'd feel back then
I wouldn't take another step
I'd hold the moment 'til the end
But everything ends
Everything ends

[Chorus]
But I opened the door and I went down the stairs
I turned back one last time just to prove you were there
You said, "If you can see me, it's all in your head"
But it feels real to me now, it felt real to me then

[Outro]
It feels real to me now, it felt real to me thenEmbed
