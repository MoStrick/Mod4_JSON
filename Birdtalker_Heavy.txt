11 ContributorsHeavy Lyrics[Verse 1]
If you're lost and you're lonely
Go and figure out why
Take a trip to your darkside
Go on and have a good cry
'Cause we're all lonely
Yeah we're all lonely together

[Verse 2]
I want to see your sadness
I want to share your sin
I want to bleed your blood
And I want to be let in
Don't you just
Don't we all just
Want to be together

[Chorus]
Leave what's heavy
What's heavy behind
Leave what's heavy
What's heavy behind

[Verse 3]
If your face is down
Take a look around
Do your fingers move?
Do your lungs inflate?
Are you tired, are you weary
Of the hidden hate you've been holding?
And did you lose that love?
Or have you never had it?
Are you feeling sad 'cause you did a bad thing?
You might also like[Chorus]
Leave what's heavy
What's heavy behind
Leave what's heavy
What's heavy behind

[Verse 4]
Are you feeling fearful brother?
Are you feeling fearful sister?
The only way to lose that fearful feeling
Replace it with love that's healing
Are you feeling fearful brother?
Are you feeling fearful sister?

[Chorus]
Leave what's heavy
What's heavy behind
Leave what's heavy
What's heavy behind
Leave what's heavy
What's heavy behind
Leave what's heavy
What's heavy behind1Embed
